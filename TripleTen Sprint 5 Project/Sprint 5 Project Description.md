# Storytelling with Data: Superstore Returns Analysis

## Description
This project aims to provide an analysis for the CEO of the Superstore to understand the root causes of returned orders and suggest strategies to reduce return volumes. By leveraging data visualization techniques in Tableau, we will explore different views on return rates, design a monitoring dashboard, and present our findings to facilitate decision-making.

## Tasks
### 1. What is Causing Returns?
1. **Data Preparation**: Join the Returns table with the Orders table and create a calculated field for return indication (0 for null, 1 for "Yes").
2. **Return Rate Analysis**:
   - Scatterplot: Correlation between total sales and returns aggregated by product subcategory.
   - Bar Chart: Return rate by product category.
   - Customer Return Rate: Identify customers prone to returns, filtering out single-order customers.
   - Geographic Analysis: Map showing return rates by state or city.
   - Temporal Analysis: Return rate trends over time (month, week).
   - Composite Charts: Explore return rates based on multiple factors like date, geography, and product category.

### 2. Building a Dashboard for Monitoring Returns
1. **Dashboard Design Mockup**:
   - Create low-fidelity sketches of dashboard variations (at least 3).
   - Choose the preferred design for implementation.
2. **Dashboard Template Creation**:
   - Develop a template using empty containers to match the chosen mockup.
   - Submit a screenshot of the template with empty containers.
3. **Dashboard Development**:
   - Incorporate worksheets into the dashboard template.
   - Finalize the dashboard with relevant markers, images, and titles.

### 3. Presenting Your Analysis and Dashboard
1. **Story Construction**:
   - Draft a story arc with captions for each Story Point.
   - Summarize the analysis of returns, root causes, and dashboard components.
2. **Content Creation**:
   - Develop worksheets and dashboards to support the story arc.
   - Create presentation-style slides within Tableau.
3. **Presentation Delivery**:
   - Prepare a 3 to 5-minute presentation of the Tableau Story.
   - Record the presentation using screen recording software or submit as a PDF.

## Conclusion
Through this project, we aim to provide actionable insights to the CEO of the Superstore regarding the factors contributing to returned orders. By visualizing return rates and identifying root causes through data analysis, we aim to assist in implementing strategies to mitigate return volumes and improve customer satisfaction.
