# Data Visualization Project: Saving SuperStore

## Description

Welcome to the Saving SuperStore data visualization project! In this project, we aim to analyze the operations of the superstore to identify areas of profitability and potential improvements. Through the use of Tableau visualizations, we will delve into profit and loss centers, advertising effectiveness, and returned items to provide actionable insights for the superstore's management team.

## Part 1: Profits & Losses

1. **Profit Centers Analysis**: Utilize pairs of dimensions to identify the two biggest profit centers and two biggest loss-makers within the superstore. Justify conclusions with visualizations.
2. **Product Analysis**: Determine which products the superstore should stop selling based on profitability. Justify conclusions with visualizations.
3. **Subcategory Focus**: Recommend three product subcategories for the superstore to focus on and three to discontinue based on profitability analysis.

## Part 2: Advertising

1. **Optimal Advertising Strategy**: Identify the three best combinations of states and months to advertise in, considering average profit per unit sold. Visualize the average profit for each month of the year in those states and propose an advertising budget based on return on ad spend ratio.

## Part 3: Returned Items

1. **Return Rate Analysis**: Calculate return rates for products and customers based on the Returns table joined with the Orders table. Visualize which products and customers have the highest return rates.
2. **Profit vs. Return Rate**: Create a visualization of the average profit against the average return rate on a chosen dimension (e.g., state, shipping mode, product type) to argue for or against continuing business based on this dimension.

## Conclusion

Through comprehensive data visualization and analysis, this project aims to provide actionable recommendations for the superstore to increase profitability, optimize advertising strategies, and mitigate return rates. By leveraging Tableau's visualization capabilities, we aim to offer valuable insights to help the superstore navigate challenges and thrive in the competitive retail landscape.
