Data Visualization Notes

1. Upon looking for which categories + ship mode had the highest profit, I noticed that furniture was the lowest, and even had no returns for some sub-categories with the exception of same day shipping. I suggest limiting what type of furniture you sell. **Tables, Bookcases, and Supplies** were among the lowest churners for your business. **Accesories, Copiers, and Phones** were your best sellers. 
2. Certain regions favor certain sub-categories of products; the following made the most **profit**

Central: **Copiers, Phones, Accesories**

East: **Copiers, Phones, Binders **

South: **Phones, Accesories, Chairs**

West: **Copiers, Accesories, Binders**

3. Third sheet gathers all products sold and orders them by the amount of profit produced, based on this, the worst product sold is Cubify CubeX 3D Printer Double Head Print, it is 8,800 dolars in the negative, i.e. losing 8,800 dollars for you guys.



**Advertising**

1. Visualization made of a map of the states, and color coded to show profitability with combination of month. When narrowed down, the three states/months with the most profit are: (Indiana, October), (Vermont, November), (Missouri, October)

Based on these findings, i'd say advertising in these states in these months or even quarters would be the best option to get excellent ROAS. 

**Returned Products**

1. Visualization of returned products shows which products have been returned the most. Among the highest returned products are: KI Adjustable Height Table, Global Leather Task Chair (Black), Advantus Push Pins, Global Troy Executive Leather Low-Back Tilter, and Staple Envelope.
2. A visualization of products returns and average profits (segmented by sub-category) shows that when gathered by average profit, Copiers, Envelopes, and Storage are on top for average profit. For average returns,  it is binders, papers, and phones. 

Products with low profitability and high rate of return may suggest stepping away from a certain sub-category. The average profit of furnishings coupled with the high count of returns suggest stepping away from this subcategory. Chairs should also be considered coming in just behind furnishings with the amount of returns in correlation with the amount of average profit produced.
