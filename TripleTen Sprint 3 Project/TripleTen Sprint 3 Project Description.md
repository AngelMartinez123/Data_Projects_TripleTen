# E-Commerce Business Analytics Project

## Description

This project involves analyzing raw transaction logs from an e-commerce company to derive insights into user behavior, conversion funnels, cohort analysis, and retention rates. The dataset comprises event logs capturing user activities such as product views, shopping cart interactions, and purchases.

## Tasks

### Part 1: Build a Conversion Funnel

1. **Data Exploration**: Analyze the "raw_user_activity" tab to understand the dataset's structure and contents.
2. **Conversion Funnel Creation**: Create a conversion funnel in a pivot table format to track user interactions from product page views to purchases.
3. **Conversion Rate Calculations**: Utilize formulas to compute total conversion rates and conversion rates between each stage of the funnel.

### Part 2: Prepare Data for Cohort Analysis

1. **Filter Purchases**: Isolate purchase events from the "raw_user_activity" sheet into a new tab named "purchase_activity."
2. **Calculate First Purchase Dates**: Determine the first purchase date for each user and transfer this information to the purchase activity data.
3. **Set Up Monthly Data for Cohorts**: Create new columns in the purchase activity data to categorize events and first purchase dates by month for cohort analysis.

### Part 3: Calculate Retention Rates

1. **Group Data into Cohorts**: Use pivot tables to organize purchase data into cohorts based on the month of users' first purchases.
2. **Calculate Overall Retention Rates**: Develop a table to calculate retention rates for each cohort month by month.

### Part 4: Organize and Document Spreadsheet

1. **Fill in Executive Summary**: Summarize analysis results and provide insights into conversion funnel performance and retention rates.
2. **Reorder Sheets**: Organize spreadsheet tabs with the "Table of Contents" and "Executive Summary" first, followed by analytical results, calculation sheets, and raw data.
3. **Format Spreadsheets**: Enhance readability by formatting numbers, dates, and tables, adding borders, utilizing bold fonts, and highlighting cells with calculations.
