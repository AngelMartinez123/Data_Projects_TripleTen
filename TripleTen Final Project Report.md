**Important to note, data used was the Zomato data provided, only thing that was touched was how the data was joined, i ultimately ended up joining all tables together.**

**Key Observations and Insights:**

1. **Cuisine and Ratings Analysis:**
   - I began by examining the distribution of ratings across different cuisine types. Notably, cuisines such as Ice Cream, Indian and Desserts emerged as popular choices among customers. *how might future data, and the inclusion of 'subcategories' affect this?*

2. **Revenue Generation and Cuisine Trends:**
   - Organizing restaurants based on total sales amounts revealed interesting trends, with foods like Ice Cream and Desserts dominating the revenue charts. This observation prompted further investigation into the regional distribution of restaurants and its impact on sales.

3. **Regional Analysis:**
   - An analysis of restaurant locations highlighted a concentration of establishments in Indian cities, evident from the predominant use of INR (Indian rupees) as the currency. This geographical insight provided context for understanding cuisine preferences and revenue patterns.

4. **Insights into Menu Optimization:**
   - Notably, restaurants specializing in desert cuisines garnered high ratings despite relatively low sales. This suggests potential opportunities for menu expansion to capitalize on customer preferences and drive revenue growth.

5. **Competitive Landscape:**
   - Examination of top-rated restaurants revealed a focus on desert-based cuisines, with notable outliers such as Domino's Pizza. The lack of competitor variations in menu items, except for popular choices like paneer and masala, presents opportunities for differentiation and innovation.

6. **Recommendations for Revenue Growth:**
   - To boost popularity and revenue, I propose incentivizing frequent ordering among users, particularly within the 100-400 INR price range. Additionally, introducing menu options featuring popular ingredients like paneer, chicken, or masala could attract a wider customer base and enhance sales, however like mentioned before these three items being the only ones with decent repetition also give us a case for being able to differentiate.

7. **Future Considerations:**
   - While analyzing peak ordering times wasn't feasible due to data limitations, dates were including day, month, quarter, and year. This allowed us to see a possibie trend appearing in a quarter to waurter basis with Q2 and Q4 having the least activity. This could be an opportunity to give out discount codes to customers, to keep them in our funnel and maintain a good LTV from customers. Possibly even suggest popular restaurants on top of that discount, and we will see customers repeating always and flooding us with orders in no time! In future iterations we could explore this aspect [exact order time] to optimize app infrastructure and enhance customer experience through targeted promotions and incentives.

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, in this analysis I have provided valuable insights into restaurant performance, highlighting opportunities for revenue optimization and menu innovation. By leveraging these insights, Zomato can better support its partner restaurants and enhance customer satisfaction within its platform.
